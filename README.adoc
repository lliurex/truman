== TRUMan (Trusted Resources Usage Manager)

'TRUMan' is basically a reverse proxy (currently based on nginx) that provides a single access point to any service offered locally by the host.
The proxy handles https requests to port 8443 on localhost. The service certificate is signed by a local CA configured to be self trusted.
'TRUMan' also provides necessary CORS (cross origin resource sharing) headers to avoid problems related to both CORS policies and untrusted self-signed certificates.
In addition to the proxy functionality, it also provides the ability to generate certificates signed by the local CA of the host.
Although it was initially designed to simplify access to n4d, 'TRUMan' is easily expandable to support any other http service.
